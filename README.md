## Introduction

Deforestation, land cover changes, and ForestCut detection are critical global challenges. By leveraging satellite data from **Sentinel-2 Surface Reflectance**, we can analyze vegetation health using the **Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI)**. This project integrates **Google Earth Engine** for spatial analysis and **LSTM models** to forecast NDVI trends. 

### Key Features:
- Scalable NDVI time series analysis.
- Temporal ForestCut and land cover classification.
- LSTM model for predicting future NDVI trends.

## Methodology

### Study Area and Data Acquisition
The study focuses on **Indore, India** (Lat: 22.7196, Long: 75.8788) but is adaptable to any region globally. Data from **2017-2024** was sourced from **COPERNICUS/S2_SR_HARMONIZED** on GEE.  

> **Data Preprocessing**:  
> - Cloud masking using the SCL layer.  
> - NDVI computation as:  
>
>   NDVI = (NIR - RED) / (NIR + RED)

### Seasonal Analysis
Seasonal NDVI trends were categorized:  
- **Winter**: Decemberâ€“February  
- **Summer**: Marchâ€“May  
- **Monsoon**: Juneâ€“September  
- **Autumn**: Octoberâ€“November  

---

### ForestCut Detection
By analyzing NDVI changes:
- **Deforestation**: NDVI decrease > -0.30  
- **Afforestation**: NDVI increase > 0.30  
- **No Change**: Variation within Â±0.20

## LSTM Model for Prediction

Using **LSTM networks**, future NDVI trends were predicted:
- **Input**: NDVI and temporal features.
- **Output**: Predicted NDVI values.  
- **Metrics**: Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE).

### Model Performance

## Applications
1. **Deforestation Monitoring**: Early detection and visualization of forest loss.
2. **Vegetation Health Forecasting**: Predictive analysis using LSTM.
3. **Scalable Methodology**: Apply globally via Google Earth Engine.

---

## Limitations
- **Cloud Cover**: Challenges in image availability during monsoons.  
- **Data Quality**: NDVI values depend on accurate atmospheric correction.  
- **Model Limitations**: LSTM accuracy varies with data complexity.

## Conclusions
This project successfully demonstrates:
- Scalable NDVI analysis using Google Earth Engine.
- Predictive capabilities of LSTM models for vegetation monitoring.  
- Insights into deforestation and afforestation trends globally.
